# CLAIMS.md — Verification Log

## Card 1: Bauhaus

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** The Bauhaus was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany in 1919
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/artists/399
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** MoMA's artist page for Gropius confirms founding date and location. The school moved to Dessau in 1925 and Berlin in 1932 before closing in 1933.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** Faculty included Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee who developed the Vorkurs
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/works/189319
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** The Vorkurs (foundation course) was actually initiated by Johannes Itten, then revised by Moholy-Nagy and Albers. Kandinsky and Klee taught within the program but didn't design it. I adjusted my language to say "faculty including" rather than implying they created the Vorkurs.

## Card 2: Swiss Style

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Akzidenz-Grotesk and later Helvetica became the movement's signature typefaces
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7233
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Helvetica was designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas type foundry in 1957, originally named "Neue Haas Grotesk." MoMA holds specimens in their design collection.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann championed the mathematical grid
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/works/6775
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Müller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" (1981) is the definitive text. MoMA holds his poster work. Hofmann's "Graphic Design Manual" (1965) codified typographic principles at Basel.

## Card 3: New Wave Typography

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Wolfgang Weingart deliberately fractured the Swiss grid that his teachers had perfected
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/artists/2330
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Weingart studied and then taught at the Basel School of Design. His teachers included Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann — both core Swiss Style figures. He saw his work as extending Swiss ideas, not rejecting them. MoMA's artist page confirms his Basel connection.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** April Greiman extended Weingart's experiments into early digital tools
- **Source link(s):** https://www.cooperhewitt.org/design-topics/women-in-design/april-greiman/
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Cooper Hewitt's page on Greiman confirms her as a pioneer of early Macintosh-based design. She studied under Weingart at Basel before bringing those ideas to CalArts and her Los Angeles practice.

## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

The AI initially stated that the Bauhaus faculty "created" the Vorkurs foundation course. This felt too broad — I knew multiple people were involved but wasn't sure who actually designed it. I checked MoMA's Bauhaus exhibition records and found that Johannes Itten created the original Vorkurs in 1919, which was later restructured by László Moholy-Nagy and Josef Albers. Kandinsky and Klee taught color theory and form within the program but didn't design the curriculum. I revised my card to use "developed" with the listed names rather than attributing creation of the Vorkurs to them specifically.
