## What I Think I Know

- Bauhaus was a German design school, early 20th century, closed by Nazis
- Swiss Style = grids + Helvetica, very clean, used for corporate design
- New Wave was a reaction against Swiss — more expressive, broke the grid
- April Greiman was involved in New Wave, early digital work

## What I'm Unsure About

- Was Bauhaus actually the first to say "form follows function" or did that come from architecture (Louis Sullivan)?
- What's the actual difference between Swiss Style and Minimalism? They look similar.
- Was Weingart actually a student of Hofmann, or is that oversimplified?
- Did New Wave come before or after Postmodernism in graphic design?

## Vocabulary I Need

- Vorkurs — what exactly was taught?
- Mathematical grid vs. modular grid — same thing?
- What does "objective photography" mean in this context?
- Figure-ground — I've heard this but can't define it precisely
- Akzidenz-Grotesk — how does it relate to Helvetica?

## Pinned: Concept Map (from AI)

```
Bauhaus (1919–1933)
├── Core: Unity of art + craft + technology
├── Method: Vorkurs foundation course
├── Visual: Geometric abstraction, primary colors, sans-serif
├── Key figures: Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, Klee, Albers
└── Legacy → feeds directly into...

Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)
├── Core: Systematic, objective visual communication
├── Method: Mathematical grid, asymmetric layout
├── Visual: Helvetica, objective photography, negative space
├── Key figures: Müller-Brockmann, Hofmann, Ruder
└── Dominance → provokes reaction...

New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)
├── Core: Expressive rule-breaking FROM WITHIN the Swiss tradition
├── Method: Deconstructed grid, layered type, collage
├── Visual: Bitmap imagery, overlapping elements, texture
├── Key figures: Weingart, Greiman, (later: Carson in Grunge)
└── Note: NOT random — trained in Swiss fundamentals first
```

## Pinned: Vocabulary List (from AI)

Selected 20 terms — moved to AGENTS.md controlled vocabulary table.

Discarded terms that were too vague: "design thinking" (overloaded term), "visual language" (too broad), "artistic expression" (banned territory).

## Pinned: Confusions & Boundaries (from AI)

1. **Bauhaus vs. Art Deco:** Both early 20th century. Bauhaus = stripped to function; Art Deco = ornamented luxury. They were literally ideological opponents.

2. **Swiss Style vs. Minimalism:** Swiss Style uses grids to organize COMPLEX information clearly. Minimalism reduces the information itself. Swiss = systematic clarity; Minimalism = aesthetic reduction.

3. **New Wave vs. Grunge:** New Wave (Weingart, Greiman) broke rules with formal training underneath — they understood what they were breaking. Grunge (Carson) rejected the rules entirely, including legibility as a design value.

4. **Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus:** Bauhaus was a school with diverse output (furniture, architecture, typography). Swiss Style codified specifically Bauhaus's graphic/typographic ideas into a repeatable system.

## My Decisions

- **Card 3 movement choice:** New Wave Typography — because the lineage is cleaner (Weingart studied under Hofmann, Greiman studied under Weingart) and it shows trained rebellion rather than pure rejection.
- **Expert for critique:** Wolfgang Weingart — he bridges Swiss and New Wave, so he can critique all three cards from a position of knowing both sides.
- **Anything I changed my mind about after research:**
  - I thought "form follows function" was a Bauhaus original — it's actually from Louis Sullivan (architecture, 1896). Bauhaus adopted and popularized it in design context. Adjusted my card language to say "core principle" not "coined the phrase."
  - I thought Swiss Style and Minimalism were basically the same thing. They're not. This distinction became my "Not to be confused with" for Card 2.
