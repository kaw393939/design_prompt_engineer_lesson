# Submission — Design Curator Cards (Example)

## Project

**Design Curator Cards** — A one-page static site presenting three design movements as museum-label-quality Curator Cards.

**Live Link:** [Deployed on GitHub Pages]

## Cards

1. **Bauhaus** (1919–1933) — 112 words
2. **Swiss Style** (1950s–1970s) — 101 words
3. **New Wave Typography** (1970s–1980s) — 105 words

## Orchestration Log

I used the "Explore → Pin → Promote" workflow across 5 major prompts. The most significant correction came during the Expert Critique phase: running a Wolfgang Weingart critique on my New Wave card revealed that Weingart explicitly saw himself as extending Swiss design, not rejecting it. This changed the framing of my entire third card — from "rebellion" to "trained rule-breaking from within." The AI also initially attributed the Vorkurs to the wrong faculty members, which I caught and corrected via MoMA records.
