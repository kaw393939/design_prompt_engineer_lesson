    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, unified fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical roof. Its core principle — <em>form follows function</em> — demanded that every visual decision serve a purpose. Faculty including Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee developed a foundation curriculum (Vorkurs) emphasizing geometric abstraction, primary colors, and modular composition. The school's output — from typography to furniture to architecture — established the blueprint for modern design education. When the Nazis closed it in 1933, its diaspora seeded modernist thinking worldwide.</p>

      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Art Deco, because while both emerged in the early 20th century, Art Deco embraced ornamentation and luxury, while Bauhaus stripped design to functional essentials.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified the founding date, Vorkurs curriculum structure, and faculty roles against MoMA's exhibition records and artist pages.

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The International Typographic Style, born in Switzerland in the 1950s, codified Bauhaus principles into a systematic methodology. Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann championed the mathematical grid, asymmetric layouts, and objective photography over illustration. Akzidenz-Grotesk and later Helvetica became its signature typefaces — neutral, legible, universal. The style's insistence on clarity and visual hierarchy over self-expression made it the default language of corporate identity, wayfinding systems, and scientific communication for decades.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tags">
        <span class="tag">mathematical grid</span>
        <span class="tag">Helvetica</span>
        <span class="tag">asymmetric layout</span>
        <span class="tag">objective photography</span>
        <span class="tag">visual hierarchy</span>
      </div>
      <p class="card-meta links">

        <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/6775">MoMA — Typographic Composition</a>
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Minimalism, because Swiss Style uses systematic grids and typographic rules to organize complex information clearly, while Minimalism reduces content itself to the fewest possible elements.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified Müller-Brockmann's grid methodology against MoMA's poster collection records and cross-referenced Helvetica's origin at the Haas type foundry (1957).

    <!-- Card 3: New Wave Typography -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1970s–1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>New Wave typography, pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart at the Basel School of Design, deliberately fractured the Swiss grid that his own teachers had perfected. Working from within the tradition, Weingart layered type, broke column rules, and introduced collage and compositional tension into what had been pristine compositions. His student April Greiman extended these experiments into early digital tools, merging bitmap imagery and overlapping grids. New Wave proved that systematic training could fuel rebellion — the designers who broke the rules understood them deeply first.</p>

      <div class="tags">
        <span class="tag">deconstructed grid</span>
        <span class="tag">layered typography</span>
        <span class="tag">bitmap imagery</span>
        <span class="tag">post-modernism</span>
        <span class="tag">compositional tension</span>
      </div>
      <p class="card-meta links">
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
        <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/design-topics/women-in-design/april-greiman/">Cooper Hewitt — April Greiman</a> ·
        <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/artists/2330">MoMA — Wolfgang Weingart</a>
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Grunge typography (David Carson's era), because New Wave emerged from formal Swiss training and maintained underlying structure, while Grunge rejected legibility itself as a design value.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified Weingart's Basel teaching role and Greiman's connection to his workshop via MoMA's artist records and Cooper Hewitt's design biography.
