This assignment is designed to transform you from a passive coder into a Strategic Orchestrator. In the 2026 tech landscape, your value isn't just in writing syntax—it’s in your ability to design a mission and manage AI agents to execute it perfectly.

Assignment: The Career-Engineered Portfolio
Theme: Orchestrating Agentic AI for Professional Presence

Target Audience: NJIT Students (Tech & Consulting)

1. The Strategic Workflow: "Reverse-Engineered Orchestration"
Phase 1: The "North Star" Definition (Self-Reflection)
Before you open an IDE, define your Market Outcome. You cannot market yourself if you don't know who you are selling to.

The Job Seeker: Targeted at recruiters in high-growth sectors (e.g., Fintech in NYC, NJ Defense Tech).

The Consultant: Targeted at business owners needing specific automation or web solutions.

Phase 2: The Strategy Interview (Discovery)
Open your AI-powered IDE (VS Code with Copilot, Cursor, or Windsurf). Treat the AI as your Technical Co-founder.

The Prompt: > "I am an NJIT student. My goal is [Insert Outcome]. Act as my CTO. Interview me to determine the best web strategy to achieve this. Ask me 8–10 questions about my skills, the 'proof' I have (projects), and my target audience. Do not write code yet; we are in the strategy phase."

The Debate: Answer the questions. If the AI suggests a technology you don't know, challenge it: "Why that specific stack? Is there a lighter version we can deploy faster?" You must disagree or pivot at least once.

Phase 3: The AGENTS.md (The Master Letter)
In 2026, professional AI orchestration uses a "Source of Truth" file. You will create an AGENTS.md file in your repo root. This is your "Master Implementation Letter."

Action: Command the AI to summarize your strategy into this format:

"Summarize our strategy into an AGENTS.md file. This must include:
The Mandate: The target career outcome.
The Tech Stack: Chosen tools (and 'Why').
The Sitemap: Hero, Case Studies, and a Lead-Gen form.
Non-Negotiables: Mobile-responsiveness, SEO-optimized keywords for NJ/NY, and a specific 'Call to Action' (CTA)."
2. The Build: Manager vs. Engineer
Now, you switch roles. You are the Manager; the AI is the Lead Engineer.

The Handoff: Ensure the agent has read your AGENTS.md.

The Command: > "I am the PM. You are the Lead Engineer. Follow the AGENTS.md to build the site. Scaffolding first. Do not write logic until I approve the file structure."

The CTA Requirement: Your site must have a clear "Call to Action."

Job Seekers: "Download my Technical Case Study" or "View my GitHub Contributions."

Consultants: "Get a Free Automation Audit" or "Schedule a 15-min Strategy Call."

3. Submission: The GitHub Repository
Your final submission will be a single GitHub repository link. The repo must contain:

A. The README.md
This is the "Human-Facing" page. It must include:

Project Title: (e.g., "The Newark AI-Automation Consulting Hub")

Live Link: A link to your deployed site (using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify).

The Orchestration Log: A brief section (2–3 sentences) describing one "hallucination" or technical error the AI made and how you corrected it.

B. The AGENTS.md
This is the "AI-Facing" page. It should be the exact text of the "Master Letter" you sent to your coding agent to initiate the build.

C. The Codebase
 

4. Grading: The "Professional Vibe" Check
A "Professional" grade is awarded if a visitor knows exactly what you offer within 5 seconds of landing on your site.

Goal	Weak CTA (C-Level)	Strong CTA (A-Level)
Job Seeker	"Email me."	"Request My Technical Resume"
Consultant	"I build websites."	"Claim Your Free AI Readiness Score"
