    <!-- ============ PHASE 1: EXPLORATION ============ -->
    <h2>Phase 1: Exploration (Intake)</h2>
    <p>Use these to survey the territory. Don't trust outputs yet — you're gathering raw material.</p>

    <h3>Concept Map</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Create a concept map showing how these three design movements relate to each other:
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
3. [New Wave Typography OR Grunge Typography]

Show: key figures, core principles, what each movement inherited from or rejected about the previous one. Use plain text with indentation — no images.
    </div>

    <h3>Controlled Vocabulary</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Generate a controlled vocabulary list of 20 domain-specific terms used in design history when discussing Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and [New Wave / Grunge Typography].

For each term provide:
- The term
- A one-sentence definition (max 15 words)
- Which movement(s) it applies to

Only include terms a design professional would use. No vague words like "creative" or "innovative."
    </div>

    <h3>Confusions &amp; Boundaries</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
What are the most common confusions between these movements?
1. Bauhaus vs. Art Deco
2. Swiss Style vs. Minimalism
3. New Wave vs. Grunge Typography
4. Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus

For each pair, explain in 2–3 sentences what people commonly get wrong and how to tell them apart.
    </div>

    <h3>Search Query Builder</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
I need to find primary sources (museum collections, original works, archival records) for these design movements: Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and [New Wave / Grunge].

Suggest 5 specific search queries I could use on MoMA.org, Cooper Hewitt, or Google Scholar to find:
- Original posters, prints, or objects
- Exhibition records
- Credible academic descriptions

Format: the exact search string I should paste into the search box.
    </div>

    <!-- ============ PHASE 2: PRODUCTION ============ -->
    <h2>Phase 2: Production (Write + Refine)</h2>
    <p>You should have your <code>AGENTS.md</code> and <code>CURATOR_NOTES.md</code> filled in before running these.</p>

    <h3>Draft the Three Labels</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Read my AGENTS.md (pasted below) and write 3 Curator Cards.

Each card must follow this exact schema:
- Title: Movement name and date range
- Body: 80–120 words, museum-label tone (authoritative, precise, no fluff)
- Tags: exactly 5 domain-specific vocabulary terms
- Examples: 2 real links to museum collections or credited archives
- Confusion: "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
- Accountability: "I verified this by checking [source]."

Use ONLY the vocabulary from my controlled vocabulary list.
If you are unsure about any fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.

    <h3>Self-Audit Against Constraints</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Audit these 3 Curator Cards against the following constraints. For each card, report:

1. Word count (must be 80–120)
2. Number of vocabulary tags (must be exactly 5)
3. Number of example links (must be exactly 2)
4. Does "Not to be confused with..." sentence exist? Is it factually defensible?
5. Does the accountability note reference a specific source?
6. Any vague words that should be replaced with domain terms?
7. Any claims that need VERIFY flags?

    <h3>Rewrite 10% Shorter (Token Discipline)</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Rewrite each of these 3 Curator Cards to be 10% shorter without losing any factual content or domain vocabulary. 

Rules:
- Cut filler words, not facts
- Keep all 5 tags, 2 links, confusion line, and accountability note
- Maintain museum-label tone
- Show the word count before and after for each card

    <!-- ============ PHASE 3: EXPERT CRITIQUE ============ -->
    <h2>Phase 3: Named Expert Critique</h2>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> Expert mode is a critique lens, not a history simulator. The AI is not channeling a real person — it's using their documented perspective to stress-test your work. No fake quotes. No invented anecdotes. If the AI generates something you can't source, cut it.
    </div>

    <p>Pick <strong>one expert</strong> from the list below. Run the critique, then implement the feedback.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Expert</th>
          <th>Known For</th>

    <h3>The Critique Prompt</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Review my Curator Card about [MOVEMENT] as if you were [EXPERT NAME].

Using only [EXPERT]'s documented writings, teachings, and known positions:
1. What would they praise about this description?
2. What would they challenge or correct?
3. Is the vocabulary appropriate to how they discussed design?
4. What's missing that they would consider essential?

If you are unsure about a fact or attribution, write VERIFY instead of guessing.
Do not invent quotes. Do not fabricate anecdotes.

    <h3>Implement the Feedback</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Based on the expert critique above, revise my Curator Card.

Rules:
- Keep within 80–120 words
- Only implement feedback that is factually verifiable
- If the critique suggested something I can't verify, note it but don't include it
- Show what changed and why

    <!-- ============ PHASE 4: MICRO-DRAFT ============ -->
    <h2>Bonus: Micro-Draft Test</h2>
    <p>Use this <em>before</em> the full draft to test whether your AGENTS.md is working.</p>

    <h3>Test Label (One Card Only)</h3>
    <div class="prompt-block">
      <span class="label">Copy/Paste</span>
Using the AGENTS.md below, write ONLY the Bauhaus card as a test.
Follow every constraint exactly. I want to see if my instructions produce the right output before I commit to all three.

    </div>

    <p>If the test label misses the mark, fix your AGENTS.md before continuing. The problem is almost always in your instructions, not the AI.</p>
