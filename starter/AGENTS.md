# AGENTS.md — AI Instructions

> This file is your "master letter" to the AI. Everything the AI needs to know about your project goes here.
> You will write a version of this file for every project this semester.

## Audience & Tone

- **Audience:** Museum visitors with general interest in design (not experts)
- **Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Think museum wall label — precise, confident, no fluff.
- **Reading level:** Educated adult, no jargon without context

## Hard Constraints

- **Word count per card:** 80–120 words
- **Number of cards:** 3 (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Reaction)
- **Vocabulary tags per card:** exactly 5
- **Example links per card:** exactly 2 (must be real, working URLs)
- **Required elements per card:**
  - "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
  - "I verified this by checking [source]."

## Banned Words

Do not use these vague words in any card:

- creative, innovative, revolutionary, iconic
- interesting, unique, beautiful, amazing
- game-changing, groundbreaking, cutting-edge
- basically, essentially, literally

Replace with specific domain vocabulary.

## Controlled Vocabulary

Use these terms. If a term is not on this list, define it before using it.

*Aim for 15–25 terms total. Build this list during your Exploration phase.*

## Verification Rule

If you are unsure about any fact, date, attribution, or claim: write **VERIFY** instead of guessing. I will check it myself.

Do not invent quotes. Do not fabricate anecdotes. Do not attribute ideas to people without sourced evidence.
